The Portal Project Teaching Database is a simplified version of the Portal
Project Database designed for teaching. It provides a real world example of
life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to
teach many aspects of data analysis and management, but with many complexities
removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught.

The database is currently available in csv, json, and sqlite.

Use of this dataset should cite: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459

This database is not designed for research as it intentionally removes some of
the real-world complexities. The [original database is published at Ecological
Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and this version of the
database should be used for research purposes.
